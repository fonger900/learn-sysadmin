# Text Editors

You will spend a lot of time editing configuration files. Knowing a terminal-based text editor is crucial.

## Nano
Easiest for beginners.
- `nano filename`: Open file
- `Ctrl + O`: Save (Write Output)
- `Ctrl + X`: Exit

## Vim
Powerful, modal editor.
- `vim filename`: Open file
- `i`: Insert mode (type text)
- `Esc`: Exit insert mode
- `:w`: Save
- `:q`: Quit
- `:wq`: Save and quit
- `:q!`: Quit without saving

## Emacs
Another powerful alternative, highly extensible.
