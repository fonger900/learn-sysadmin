# Introduction to Linux

## What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system (OS) kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution.

## Kernel vs. OS
- **Kernel**: The core component that manages the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices.
- **OS**: The complete system including the kernel, system utilities, libraries, and shell.

## A Brief History
From its humble beginnings as a hobby project, Linux has grown to dominate the supercomputer and server markets. It is the core of Android, powering billions of mobile devices.

## Distributions
Users rarely interact with the kernel directly; instead, they use a "distro" like Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, or Arch Linux.
