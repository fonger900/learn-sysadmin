# The Shell & Navigation

## The Terminal
The CLI (Command Line Interface) is your cockpit. It allows you to communicate directly with the system.

## Basic Commands

### `pwd`
Print Working Directory. Shows you where you are.
```bash
$ pwd
/home/user
```

### `ls`
List directory contents.
```bash
$ ls
Documents Downloads Music
```

### `cd`
Change Directory.
```bash
$ cd Documents
```

## Absolute vs Relative Paths
- **Absolute**: Starts from root `/` (e.g., `/home/user/docs`)
- **Relative**: Starts from current location (e.g., `docs/`)
