# Networking Basics

## What is a Network?
A network is a collection of computers, servers, mainframes, network devices, peripherals, or other devices connected to one another to allow the sharing of data.

## LAN vs WAN
- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: A network that connects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: A telecommunications network that extends over a large geographic area for the primary purpose of computer networking.

## Basic Hardware
- **Switch**: Connects devices within a single network (LAN) and uses MAC addresses to forward data.
- **Router**: Connects different networks together (e.g., your home LAN to the Internet WAN) and uses IP addresses to route data.
