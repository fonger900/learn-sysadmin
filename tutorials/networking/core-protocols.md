# Core Protocols

## TCP vs UDP
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Connection-oriented, reliable. "Did you get that?" "Yes." Used for HTTP, SSH, Email.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Connectionless, fast, fire-and-forget. Used for streaming, gaming, DNS.

## DNS (Domain Name System)
Translates human-readable names (`google.com`) to IP addresses (`142.250.190.46`). It's the phonebook of the internet.

## DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
Automatically assigns IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways to devices on a network so you don't have to configure them manually.

## HTTP/HTTPS
The foundation of the web. HTTPS adds TLS encryption for security.
